## Tasks

- [x] One important change that has been implemented.
- [ ] Another thing still left to do.
- [ ] Added PHP tests.
- [ ] Added JS tests.


## Describe the Approach

- Use bullet points to describe why and how you changed things.

- Assume that the reviewer might not be familiar with the particular section of the code. Try to be as descriptive as possible. That will also help in the future when looking back at the particular changeset.
